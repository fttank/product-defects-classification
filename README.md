# 🏭 Product Defects – Classification Model

## 📌 Overview  
Used supervised machine learning to classify whether a product is defective based on feature inputs (e.g. pressure, size, performance score).

## 🔍 Techniques  
- Data preprocessing  
- Train/test split  
- Logistic regression, decision trees

## 📊 Evaluation  
- Confusion matrix, accuracy score  
- Could be used in quality assurance pipelines

## 🧠 What I Learned  
- Binary classification  
- Real-world manufacturing dataset handling
